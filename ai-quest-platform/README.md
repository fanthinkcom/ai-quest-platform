# AI-Quest Platform

## AI-Quest: AI-Assisted Gamified Platform for Teamwork

AI-Quest is an innovative open-source platform designed to foster teamwork, project management, and problem-solving skills in teenagers through an engaging, AI-assisted gamified experience. It combines the motivational power of game mechanics with the rigor of structured project management, all enhanced by intelligent AI guidance.

## 🚀 Motivation

In an increasingly collaborative world, traditional education often focuses on individual assignments, leading to a gap in practical teamwork skills. AI-Quest aims to bridge this gap by providing a fun, interactive, and AI-driven environment where young learners can:
*   Develop effective collaboration habits.
*   Learn project management fundamentals in a hands-on way.
*   Engage with AI as a mentor, facilitator, and intellectual sparring partner.
*   Cultivate critical thinking by exploring diverse perspectives on challenges.

## ✨ Features (Planned)

*   **Gamified Experience:** Leverage game mechanics (quests, XP, currency, character progression) to motivate task completion and collaboration.
*   **Structured Project Management:** Tools for task breakdown, assignment, deadline tracking, and progress visualization (e.g., Kanban boards, lists).
*   **AI Mentorship & Guidance:** Intelligent AI assistance for task decomposition, resource suggestions, problem-solving prompts, and personalized feedback.
*   **AI Team Facilitation:** AI-driven support for task assignment, progress monitoring, bottleneck detection, and communication nudges.
*   **Multi-Perspective AI Commentary:** (Future) Integration with specialized AI models to offer diverse, in-depth comments on project challenges or news relevant to the project, fostering critical thinking.
*   **Comprehensive Project History:** Detailed logs and version control for all project activities.
*   **Flexible Reporting:** AI-generated reports on individual and team performance for students, teachers, and parents.

## 🏛️ High-Level Architecture

The AI-Quest platform is conceived as a multi-layered system designed for modularity and extensibility:

1.  **Gamification Layer:** Manages game mechanics, player progression, rewards, and penalties. (Inspired by Habitica's core gamification principles).
2.  **Project Management Layer:** Provides robust tools for task definition, assignment, tracking, and collaboration. (Inspired by Taskade's structured workflow and visualization capabilities).
3.  **AI Orchestration & Assistance Layer:** The intelligent core (my role) that integrates with both the Gamification and PM layers, offering AI-driven insights, guidance, automation, and project oversight. This layer will coordinate various AI functionalities (e.g., task breakdown AI, progress monitoring AI, commentary AI).
4.  **Integration Layer:** Ensures seamless communication and data flow between all components through well-defined APIs and event-driven mechanisms.
