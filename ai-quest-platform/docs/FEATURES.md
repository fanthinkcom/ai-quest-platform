# AI-Quest Platform: Features

This document outlines the planned features for the AI-Quest Platform, detailing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and potential future expansions.

## 🚀 MVP Features (Minimum Viable Product)

The MVP will exclusively focus on establishing the "AI-empowered team collaboration learning experience," guiding teenagers on how to collaborate effectively. It will provide foundational project management and AI assistance to directly address this core goal.

### 1. Core AI Assistance for Collaboration & Learning

*   **AI Task Breakdown & Structuring:**
    *   AI assists in taking a large project goal and breaking it down into manageable, structured sub-tasks.
    *   AI can suggest task dependencies and sequences.
*   **AI-Guided Task Assignment & Negotiation:**
    *   AI suggests initial task assignments to team members based on project needs (without assuming skills).
    *   AI facilitates communication for team members to negotiate and finalize task ownership.
*   **AI Progress Monitoring & Proactive Nudging:**
    *   AI tracks task status and progress within the project.
    *   AI detects potential bottlenecks or delays (e.g., overdue tasks, uneven workload).
    *   AI sends contextual reminders or nudges to individual students or the team, focusing on how to get unstuck or communicate effectively.
*   **AI Feedback on Collaboration Dynamics:**
    *   AI provides basic, objective feedback on team collaboration (e.g., "Team member X has not updated their tasks in 3 days," "Team has many overdue tasks").
    *   AI can prompt reflection on teamwork effectiveness (e.g., "What could the team do differently to improve communication on this task?").
*   **Context-Sensitive AI Guidance (Simple):**
    *   If a student explicitly asks for help on a specific task, AI can provide guidance, point to resources, or suggest problem-solving strategies.

### 2. Foundational Project Management

*   **Task Creation & Basic Details:** Allows for creating tasks with a title, description, assigned team member(s), and due date.
*   **Task Status Tracking:** Simple "To Do," "In Progress," "Done" status for tasks.
*   **Task List View:** A clear list of all tasks within a project.
*   **Basic Project History:** Records key task events (creation, assignment, status changes) to feed AI monitoring.

### 3. Basic User & Team Management

*   **User Registration & Profile:** Basic accounts for students and teachers/mentors.
*   **Team/Group Creation:** Functionality to form student teams for projects.

## ✨ Future Expansion Features

These features represent the next stages of development, building on the focused MVP.

*   **Advanced Gamification:** Full Habitica-like experience (XP, Gold, character progression, in-game items, visual rewards).
*   **Enhanced Project Management Views:** Kanban boards, Mind Maps, Gantt charts, collaborative document editing.
*   **Advanced AI Assistance:**
    *   Intelligent skill-based task assignment.
    *   AI Conflict Detection & Mediation.
    *   Multi-Perspective AI Commentary.
    *   Proactive Problem Solving (predicting roadblocks).
    *   Dynamic Learning Paths & personalized resource recommendations.
*   **External Integrations:** Optional API integrations with existing tools like Habitica, Taskade, or school LMS systems.
*   **Native Mobile Apps:** Dedicated iOS and Android applications.
*   **Advanced Reporting & Analytics:** AI-powered insights into team dynamics, individual learning, and project efficiency.
