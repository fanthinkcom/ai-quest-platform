# AI-Quest Platform: Features

This document outlines the planned features for the AI-Quest Platform, detailing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and potential future expansions.

## 🚀 MVP Features (Minimum Viable Product)

The MVP will focus on establishing a core loop of gamified project management with essential AI assistance, designed to be immediately useful for small-team projects.

### 1. Core Gamification Loop

*   **User Registration & Profile:** Basic user accounts, personalized profiles (player name, avatar).
*   **Team/Party Creation:** Students can form small teams (parties) for collaborative projects.
*   **Quest/Project Definition:** Teachers/Admins (or AI-assisted) can define projects as "Quests" with a clear goal and reward structure.
*   **Basic Task Management:**
    *   **Task Creation:** Teams can create and assign individual tasks linked to the Quest.
    *   **Task Status Update:** Simple "To Do," "In Progress," "Done" status tracking.
    *   **Due Dates:** Assign due dates to tasks.
*   **XP & Gold Earning:** Completing tasks earns Experience Points (XP) and in-game Gold for individual characters.
*   **Basic Character Progression:** Character leveling based on XP.
*   **Punishment/Reward System:** Linking task completion/failure to basic in-game rewards/penalties.

### 2. Essential Project Management

*   **Task List View:** A clear, sortable list of all tasks within a project/quest.
*   **Basic Task Details:** Each task includes a description, assigned team member(s), due date, and current status.
*   **Project History/Audit Log:** A basic record of key events related to tasks (creation, assignment, completion, status changes).

### 3. Core AI Assistance (My Role)

*   **AI Task Breakdown Suggestions:** For a given project/quest goal, the AI can provide initial suggestions for task decomposition.
*   **Proactive Nudges & Reminders:** AI monitors task due dates and progress, sending automated reminders for overdue or upcoming tasks.
*   **Context-Sensitive AI Guidance:** If a student asks for help on a specific task, the AI can provide relevant advice, resource links, or hints (e.g., "AI Mentor" persona).
*   **Initial Project Summary:** AI can generate a brief summary of project status or team performance.

### 4. Integration Layer (Initial)

*   **Internal API:** Well-defined internal APIs to connect the Gamification, Project Management, and AI Layers.
*   **Database:** Utilize SQLite for structured project data and AI-generated summaries.

## ✨ Future Expansion Features

These features represent the next stages of development, building on the MVP's foundation.

*   **Advanced Gamification:**
    *   In-game shop for purchasing gear/items with Gold.
    *   Customizable avatars and equipment.
    *   Complex skill trees and abilities tied to real-world learning.
    *   Competitive elements (leaderboards, PvP challenges between teams).
*   **Enhanced Project Management:**
    *   Multiple Project Views (Kanban board, Mind Map, Org Chart, Gantt charts).
    *   Collaborative Document Editing within tasks.
    *   Advanced User Roles & Permissions.
    *   File Attachments & Asset Management.
    *   Automated Workflow Triggers.
*   **Advanced AI Assistance:**
    *   **Intelligent Task Assignment:** AI suggests optimal task distribution based on team member skills, availability, and past performance.
    *   **AI Conflict Detection & Mediation:** AI analyzes communication patterns and project history to identify and help resolve team conflicts.
    *   **Multi-Perspective AI Commentary:** Integration with specialized AI models/MCPs to offer diverse, in-depth comments on project challenges or news relevant to the project.
    *   **Proactive Problem Solving:** AI identifies potential project roadblocks before they occur and suggests preventative measures.
    *   **Dynamic Learning Paths:** AI personalizes learning resources based on individual student needs and project challenges.
*   **External Integrations:** Optional API integrations with existing tools like Habitica (for existing Habitica users), Taskade, or school LMS systems.
*   **Native Mobile Apps:** Dedicated iOS and Android applications for an optimized mobile experience.
*   **Advanced Reporting & Analytics:** AI-powered insights into team dynamics, individual learning, and project efficiency.

This comprehensive roadmap will guide the development of AI-Quest into a robust and transformative platform.
